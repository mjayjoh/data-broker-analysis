    "We administered a Google Forms survey to college students, framed around the three categories above, and obtained 62 responses. For many questions, students were asked to select checkboxes based on their preferences (e.g., \"select all that apply\"). The exact wording of survey questions can be found in \"Survey-Questions.pdf\" in \".../raw_data/survey/\".\n",

    "While university students may not represent a completely representative sample of average Americans, we believe that this initial dataset provides insight into consumer privacy policies. "
