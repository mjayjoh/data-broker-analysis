## Project Report 2

#### **Summarize the progress you've made on your project over the last week.  Remember, your answers should be BRIEF but informative!**

This week, we cleaned and merged different data broker datasets from state websites, conducted a literature review, drafted survey questions and a tentative plan for privacy policy data collection, and began visualizing key attributes of the merged data broker dataset. We also prepared instructions for privacy policy scraping, drafting an LLM prompt to extract information from the privacy policies and outlining the manual download process after attempting to webscrape. We also looked into the process of deleting, and opting out of the sale or use of personal data.

#### **Have you made any changes in direction? If so, please describe what the change is and why you chose a new path.**

For our final deliverable, we had planned on submitting an academic paper, but after looking into the type of data we have and what we can do with it, we’ve decided to submit an experiential report instead with some interactive components (like an explanatory/investigative blog).

#### **Describe the next steps you plan to take to answer your question. Make sure you roughly describe each member's plans.**

The next steps include completing the data collection process and starting to extract information from the privacy policies. We also want to formalize the survey design, so we can begin subject recruitment shortly. Since we now have cleaned data broker names and privacy policy URLs, all three of us will manually download privacy policies. More specifically, Ornella will work on finalizing the survey and visualizing the cleaned data broker dataset, Michelle will work on prompt engineering for the LLM parser of the privacy policies, and Minjae will continue to clean the data and add additional information, such as on federal contracts, data breaches, and specific state registry data not already included.
