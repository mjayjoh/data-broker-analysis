## Q2 Question Description
### **Please state your initial brainstorming ideas for the question you plan to answer. Make sure to describe the connection to ethics, responsibility, privacy, or fairness. Remember, your answers should be BRIEF!**

### Q2.1 Problem/Question
#### **State succinctly your problem/question.**
Data brokers buy and aggregate billions of data elements on individuals, selling this sensitive data—often without explicit consent—to companies that target demographic subgroups for commercial or political gain. It is unclear what information data brokers collect, where data is transferred, and how much control consumers can actually assert over their personal data. While some states have taken steps to create centralized, state-wide data broker registries, compliance issues persist, as registries are not easily accessible and few states provide their residents with real control over their data. On top of introducing cybersecurity and fraud concerns, these troves of data can fuel civil liberties violations by powering biased algorithms, mass surveillance, and targeted political advertising.[[1]](#1)[[2]](#2)

For this project, “Unveiling the Business of Data: Data on Data Brokers,” we would like to define what data brokers are, identify the key actors involved in the data economy, and address this lack of transparency in the data broker market. We hope to shed light on this industry and answer questions about data broker practices and the difficulty of deleting personal data. Ultimately, we aim to evaluate and identify gaps in existing law and privacy practices.

### Q2.2 Methodology
#### **What methodology do you plan to use/learn to address the question?**
We will look into state registries of data brokers (required by a few states currently) and analyze data broker listings and their privacy policies. Depending on the complexity of web-scraping and collecting data on  privacy policies, we may use LLMs, with human oversight, to analyze certain attributes of policies and compare them across brokers (e.g., type of data collected, options for consumer control, etc.). We will also attempt to delete personal data from major data brokers and evaluate the actual accessibility and complexity for individuals to make such requests to data brokers, such as by counting the number of clicks it takes to delete the data.

### Q2.3 Findings
#### **What do you expect to find out?**
Although we anticipate a dearth of information online, we expect to gain insight into how extensively personal information is being collected, shared, and utilized by data brokers. For example, understanding what kind of data that data brokers collect is important to share with the public. By identifying gaps in how state governments are approaching data broker laws and assessing how accessible it is for individuals to control their personal data, we would like to find out how hostile/friendly the data market is for individuals to control their own data. These insights can inform policymaking on the state and federal level.

### Q2.4 Deliverable
#### **What type of deliverable do you plan on submitting (e.g., paper, software artifact, short movie, demonstrator, low-fidelity prototype, or any other deliverable you can justify)?**
We expect to submit a paper and release a novel, open-source dataset on data brokers.

## Q3 Next Steps
#### **Describe the next steps you plan to take to answer your question. Make sure you roughly describe each member's plans.  Remember, your answers should be BRIEF!**
We will first download state registry-level data, as well as the privacy policies of each data broker listed, to decide on the approach we should be taking in analyzing common data broker practices (e.g. reading and summarizing ourselves, using LLMs to help parse text, searching for sales to the federal government, etc.). To be more specific, Ornella will conduct research on common data broker practices and ways to delete data, Minjae will merge relevant datasets with state data broker registry data, and Michelle will read through/collect privacy policies to determine what criteria to use when comparing privacy policies.
